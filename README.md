# Setup
for istallation instructions and requirements look at the 2 linked submodules.

# Pokemon SwordShield Automation
currently only PokemonRaidFight.py
example on how to start is in starter.sh
before starting the script, go to a raid den, face the raid den and then head to the switch home menu(Pokemon SwordShield only allows one connected Controller per time, so this is necessary until i find a workaround... you also should connect every usb controller, just in case)
