# NS_automation

# Setup
for istallation instructions and requirements look at the 2 linked submodules.
and you need a capture card(a cheap one for ~20â‚¬ is good enough)

# Pokemon SwordShield Automation
currently only PokemonRaidFight.py working  
example on how to start is in starter.sh(replace bluetooth address with the address of your switch)  
before starting the RaidFight script, go to a raid den, face the raid den and then head to the switch home menu(Pokemon SwordShield only allows one connected Controller at a time, so this is necessary until i find a workaround... you also should disconnect every usb controller, just in case)
